# Brief ecosystem service description
<!-- Groundwater accounts for 99% of all liquid freshwater on Earth [@@UNWater2022] -->

<!-- ## Background -->
Groundwater recharge broadly describes the replenishment of water to a groundwater flow system [@Winter2000]. It is a part of the hydrological regulation process. There are two mains ways about how groundwater recharge service contributes to human well-being: (i) provision of water resources for human use (drinking, irrigation, and industrial use) and (ii) regulating the levels of groundwater table, which make the access to groundwater resources easier and more reliable.

<!-- ## Problem -->
In the past GEP studies, groundwater recharge service is often treated as a part of broader categories of hydrological services such as water provisioning service or flood regulation service. For example, @Ouyang.etal2020 implicitly accounted for the groundwater recharge as part of water provisioning and flood regulation services. Such a treatment of groundwater recharge service can be found in other studies as well (e.g., @Pacetti.etal2024; @Deng.etal2025; @Joshi.etal2025). Meanwhile, there are several agricultural economics and hydrology studies that focus on valuing groundwater recharge service as a regulating service. @Acharya.Barbier2000 explicitly values groundwater recharge service per se. They quantify the value of groundwater recharge as a regulating service focusing on its role in agricultural production in wetlands in northern Nigeria. They link the crop yields from recharge-supported irrigation to ecosystem value of groundwater recharge. Based on hypothetical scenarios of groundwater recharge rates, they estimate the value of groundwater recharge as a welfare change for irrigation-dependent agricultural producers in the region. Another study by @Brauman.etal2015 estimates the value of groundwater recharge regulating service as a pumping cost for water extraction saved owing to natural groundwater recharge associated with different land use types in Kona, Hawaii. They estimate the monetary value of the groundwater recharge service attributed to a specific land cover scenario as the difference in pumping costs for water before and after the land-use change. 

This study aims to provide a global-scale assessment of the value of groundwater recharge service as a regulating service. Specifically, I focus on the role of groundwater recharge in stabilizing aquifer levels, which has received limited attention in the previous GEP studies. This regulating service of groundwater recharge is important from the perspective of human well-being, as it helps maintain (or slow) the long-term decline of groundwater levels, thereby avoiding increased pumping costs to extract groundwater and circumventing the need for investment in alternative water supply sources or infrastructure adaptation (e.g., drilling deeper wells, more energy-intensive pumping system, or building reservoirs). 

<!-- ## What this study does  -->
To quantify the value of groundwater recharge regulating service, I pose the following question: *"If the recharge didnâ€™t happen, what would it cost to deliver the same amount of water to people or systems that currently benefit from it?"*. This framing aligns with the idea of the replacement cost approach. The saving in pumping costs associated with the groundwater recharge service has been used as a measure of the value of groundwater recharge in the literature (e.g., @Acharya.Barbier2000, @Brauman.etal2015). This allows for estimating the gross ecosystem product (GEP) of recharge based on the costs that would be incurred to replicate its function artificially or offset the consequences of its absence.


# Methods description

This section describes the methods used to estimate the GEP of groundwater recharge service as a regulating service. One of the pieces of information required to estimate the cost savings in pumping water due to groundwater recharge is the unit cost of pumping groundwater to the surface. Given the lack of such data globally, I rely on the engineering formula to approximate it [@Naggar2003]. The energy cost of pumping a unit volume of water (in $USD/m^3$) is given by the following equation^[Technically, the total cost of pumping groundwater consists of three components [@Naggar2003]; (i) capital cost of the pumping system, (ii) operation and maintenance cost, and (iii) energy cost which is a function of the depth of the water table. Since I will derive the value of groundwater recharge service as a difference in pumping costs with and without groundwater recharge, the capital cost and operation and maintenance cost of the pumping system, which is assumed to be constant regardless of the depth of the water table, will cancel out in the difference. Thus, I will focus only on the energy cost of pumping water.]:


$$
c(H; e_r) = A \cdot H \quad \text{, where } A = \frac{\gamma e_r}{\eta} \cdot \frac{1}{3.6 \times 10^6} 
$$

, where $H$ is the total head (in $m$), $\gamma$ is the specific weight of water (approximately $9810 N/m^3$)^[$\gamma = \rho g$, where $\rho$ is the density of water ($1000 kg/m^3$) and $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.81 m/s^2$). So , $\gamma = 1000 kg/m^3 \times 9.8 m/s^2 = 9810 N/m^3$], $\eta$ is the pumping efficiency (a value between 0 and 1), and $e_r$ is the energy price (in $USD/kWh$). The pumping efficiency means how much of the energy is actually consumed for lifting water. Although it is likely that pumping efficiency varies by region depending on the type of pumping system used, there is no global information on regional values of pumping efficiency. Here, I assume a uniform pumping efficiency of $\eta = 0.5$ based on FAO's reference value for pumping efficiency of motor driven pumps [@Phocaides2007]. The factor $3.6 \times 10^6$ is used to convert energy from joules to kilowatt-hours ($1 \, kWh = 3.6 \times 10^6 \, joules$), as electricity prices are typically expressed in units of kilowatt-hours (USD/kWh). Given a price of electricity price $e_r$ in $USD/kWh$, the energy cost of pumping water is described as a linear function of the total head $H$. 

Then the total cost required to pump $Q \, m^3$ of water is given by:

$$
TC(H; e_r) = c(H; e_r) \cdot Q
$$


Let $H_0$ be the total head when recharging does not occur, and $H_1$ be the total head when recharging occurs. Total head is the sum of the vertical distance from pump to static water level (i.e., depth to static water table, $R$) and the additional head loss due to friction in the pipes (i.e., drawdown and friction loss, $F$). Assuming that the friction loss $F$ is constant regardless of the pumping (i.e., $H_0 = R_0 + F$ and $H_1 = R_1 + F$), the difference in total costs to pump $Q \, m^3$ of water in the presence and absence of groundwater recharge is given by:
$$
\begin{aligned}
TC(H_0; e_r) - TC(H_1; e_r) 
  &= [c(R_0 + F; e_r) \cdot Q - c(R_1 + F; e_r)] Q \\
  &= A [(R_0 + F) - (R_1 + F)] Q \\
  &= A (R_0 - R_1) Q \\
  &= A \cdot \Delta R \cdot Q \\
\end{aligned}
$$

, where $\Delta R = R_0 - R_1$ is the change in the depth to the water table due to groundwater recharge. 

As the last line of the equation above shows, the necessary information to compute the cost savings in pumping water associated with groundwater recharge includes (i) the change in the depth to the water table due to groundwater recharge ($\Delta R$), (ii) the volume of water pumped ($Q$), and (iii) the coefficient $A$, which depends on the energy price ($e_r$). For the volume of water pumped ($Q$), I use the country-level groundwater withdrawal data for all sectors downloaded from FAO-AQUASTAT Core Database [@FAO2019]. The country-level price of electricity is obtained from the International Energy Agency (IEA) report [@IEA2019]. To estimate $\Delta R$, I use the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield (SWY) model. The next section describes the data sources for the SWY model and the calculation of some key watershed-specific parameters for the SWY model.

<!-- In total, I identify 11,528 watersheds globally that meet this criterion. @fig-map-watersheds shows the selected watersheds for the analysis. -->

# Data for InVEST SWY Model Inputs and Parameters 

Due to the lack of data on actual measurement of natural groundwater recharge rate globally in 2019, I will use the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield (SWY) model to estimate the amount of groundwater recharge provided from natural ecosystems. I use one of the key outputs of the SWY model called local recharge. The local recharge in the SWY model indicates the amount of net rainfall that infiltrates into the soil beyond the root zone. Given that it is the amount of water that is not used by evapotranspiration and runs off as surface water, it is a reasonable proxy for the amount of water that percolates down to the groundwater system, thus representing the natural groundwater recharge rate. Although it is possible that some portion of the local recharge may be lost through lateral subsurface flow before reaching the groundwater system, there is no global data on such information. Thus, for simplicity, I assume that all water classified as local recharge in the SWY model eventually contributes to groundwater recharge.

I conduct the analysis on a watershed scale, which is a common scale for hydrological analysis because it is a natural hydrological unit that collects precipitation and drains it into a common outlet, such as a river or lake. I restrict the analysis to watersheds that intersect regions with observed groundwater dependence for human use (e.g., domestic, agricultural, and industrial uses). To identify these watersheds, I use the global estimates of groundwater withdrawal for agricultural, domestic, and industrial sectors developed by @Nazari.etal2025. I overlay the groundwater raster with HydroBASINS v1 Level 6 watershed boundaries [@Lehner.Grill2013], and select only those watersheds that intersect at least 20 percent of grid cells with strictly positive groundwater withdrawals. 20 percent threshold is chosen because it provides a reasonable balance between including watersheds that are significantly influenced by groundwater withdrawals and excluding those with minimal or negligible groundwater use. Also, this threshold gives a reasonable coverage of watersheds that are likely to be dependent on groundwater resources for human use. In total, I identify 11,528 watersheds globally that meet this criterion. @fig-map-watersheds shows the watersheds selected for the analysis.

@tbl-data-source summarizes the sources of major input data used for watershed-scale estimation of groundwater recharge rate using the InVEST SWY model. Other than the inputs listed in the table, the SWY model also requires some important parameters including biophysical table data, threshold flow accumulation value, Beta_i parameter, and Gamma parameter. Although it is common to use the default values for these parameters, I use watershed-specific values for these parameters to better represent the local conditions of each watershed. The following sections describe how I prepare these watershed-specific parameters for the SWY model.

## Threshold Flow Accumulation Value

To determine the Threshold Flow Accumulation (TFA) parameter required by the InVEST Seasonal Water Yield model, I combined a flow accumulation raster data from HydroSHEDS Core layers (v1) and observed stream network from HydroRIVERS (v10) [@Lehner.Grill2013]

I rasterized the stream polylines to the flow-accumulation grid and identified channel head cellsâ€”stream pixels with exactly one neighboring stream cell. I then extracted the flow-accumulation value at each channel head, representing the upstream contributing area where mapped channels begin to form. The median of these headwater flow-accumulation values (expressed in number of pixels) was used as the watershedâ€™s TFA. This threshold defines the number of upslope cells required for a pixel to initiate a stream in the InVEST model and ensures consistency between the modeled and observed drainage networks.


## Biophysical Table Preparation

Biophysical table data for the InVEST SWY model requires soil-group specific curve numbers and monthly crop evapotranspiration coefficient (Kc) values for each land use/land cover (LULC) class. There is no single numbers for the curve number and Kc values for global scale. To account for the heterogeneity of the curve number and Kc values across watersheds, I prepare watershed-specific biophysical table data for each watershed used in the analysis.

For watershed-specific curve numbers, I use the GCN250 dataset [@Jaafar.etal2019]. GCN250 dataset provides the gridded data of curve numbers for global scale at 250m resolution. Using the GCN250 dataset, the map of soil hydrologic groups, and the LULC data for the watershed, I calculated the mean values of curve numbers for each soil group and LULC class within each watershed boundary. These mean curve number values are used as the watershed-specific curve numbers for each LULC class and soil hydrologic group in the SWY model.

As for global Kc values, although there is no consensus on the Kc values for each of the various land use/land cover classes, it is safe to assume that the Kc values for some land use/land cover classes are constant and similar across months and regions. For example, the Kc values for evergreen forests, grasslands, and wetlands are generally constant throughout the year. Therefore, I use constant Kc value for land use/land cover classes including including evergreen forest, deciduous forest, shrublands, urban, bare ground, snow/ice, and open water. These constant Kc values are borrowed from the previous studies [@Allen.etal1998; @Liu.etal2017]. Meanwhile, for the other land use/land cover classes (e.g., rainfed or irrigated cropland and deciduous forests), the Kc values can vary by month. For those classes, I calculate the monthly Kc values using the reflectance-based Kc (NDVI-Kc methods). This reflectance-based Kc method is widely used in the previous studies to estimate the Kc values for various land use/land cover classes (e.g., @Bausch1995; @Choudhury.etal1994; @Glenn.etal2010; @Kamble.etal2013; @Reyes-Gonzalez.etal2015). Following the previous studies, I calculate the monthly Kc values for each LULC class using the NDVI-Kc methods. The monthly NDVI data is obtained from the MODIS/Terra Vegetation Indices with 0.05 degree resolution [@Didan2021]. 

With NDVI data, monthly Kc values are calculated using the following linear equation [@Bausch1995]:

$$K_c = 1.37 \cdot NDVI + 0.069$$


## Beta_i and Gamma Parameters

Another parameter that needs to be calibrated for each watershed is the Beta_i and Gamma parameters. The Beta_i parameter in the SWY model represents the fraction of upgradient water subsidy that is available for evapotranspiration at a given location. Following the description in the InVEST SWY model documentation, Beta_i parameter is calculated as the topographic wetness index (TWI):  

$$TWI = ln(\frac{A}{tan b})$$

, where $A$ is upstream contributing area (i.e. A = flow accumulation $\times$ cell area, in $m^2$) and $b$ is the slope in radians. $A$ is calculated from the flow accumulation map. The slope is calculated from the DEM data using the `terrain` function in the `terra` R package. After deriving TWI for each grid cell of the DEM data, I calculate the mean TWI value within each watershed. This mean TWI value is used as the watershed-specific Beta_i parameter for each watershed in the SWY model to represent the average topographic subsidy available to each watershed.

The Gamma parameter controls how much of the water recharge is made available to the downgradient pixels. Gamma = 0 means that no water moves downgradient from the pixel, while Gamma = 1 means that all local recharge becomes available to downgradient pixels (default value in the SWY model). I set the Gamma parameter for each watershed based on the soil hydrologic group raster data, which is one of the input data for the SWY model as described above. This raster dataset classifies each grid cell into one of four USDA-defined hydrologic soil groups: A (group 1), B (group 2), C (group 3), and D (group 4). As the group number increases, soils become more impermeable, with Group A having the highest infiltration rates and Group D having the lowest.  

Given this gradient in lateral subsurface connectively, I assigned following Gamma values to each group:  0.95 for Group A, 0.85 for Group B, 0.75 for Group C, and 0.55 for Group D. Then, for each watershed, I calculated an area-weighted average of these Gamma values based on the fractional coverage of each soil group. 


# Table of results by country

@fig-map-gw-recharge-by-region shows the estimated groundwater recharge rates (in mm) by region in 2019. Relatively large values of groundwater recharge rates (> 50 mm) are observed in tropical regions such as Central Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America, meanwhile very low recharge rates (< 10 mm) are found in arid and semi-arid regions such as North Africa, the Middle East, and Australia. These spatial patterns of groundwater recharge rates are consistent with the findings from recent studies on global groundwater recharge estimation. For example @Lee.etal2024 estimates long-term natural groundwater recharge across Australia and finds that recharge is generally much lower than previously reported. Using more than 98,000 groundwater samples, they show that most of inland Australia receives extremely low rechargeâ€”often less than 1 to 10 mm per year. Another study done by @Mohan.etal2018 compiles 715 local groundwater recharge estimates from around the world and uses them to produce a global estimate of long-term diffuse recharge from rainfall. Across all sites, they find that mean annual recharge is about 73 mm/year with very large variability depending on climate and land cover. Their findings that recharge is highest in humid, forested tropical regions including Southeast Asia, the Amazon, and Central Africa, and lowest in arid and semi-arid regions including Australia, North Africa, and the Middle East are consistent with the what I found in this study.

While local recharge estimates from the InVEST SWY model are spatially explicit at fine resolution, it is aggregated to the country level by taking the area-weighted average of local recharge rates within each country boundary. This is because the observed groundwater withdrawal data and the pumping cost estimates are only available at the country level. 

@tbl-gw-gep-by-country presents the estimated GEP of natural groundwater recharge regulating service by country in 2019. The total GEP of groundwater recharge service across all countries is estimated to be approximately `r format(sum(ground_water_gep$ground_water_gep), big.mark = ",", scientific = FALSE)` USD in 2019. @fig-map-gw-gep shows the map of estimated GEP of groundwater recharge service by country in 2019. 

There are some important caveats to note regarding the estimated GEP of groundwater recharge service. While I use the cost of pumping water from the groundwater table to the surface as a proxy for the value of groundwater recharge service, the decreasing water table can also lead to other adverse economic consequences in other forms. For example, from the perspective of agricultural production that relies on groundwater irrigation, the declining water table decreases the amount of water that can be extracted from a well within a given time period (i.e., well yield). This can lead to insufficient water supply in timely manner for irrigation during critical crop growth stages, which in turn negatively impacts crop yields. The loss of productivity and the consequential income loss is not captured in the current analysis. Furthermore, this analysis does not account for the role of groundwater recharge that helps maintain other ecosystem services such as baseflow to rivers and wetlands, which are important for supporting biodiversity and human livelihoods for some areas. Therefore, the estimated GEP of groundwater recharge service presented here likely underestimates the total economic value of groundwater recharge service as a regulating service. Further research is needed to capture these additional values associated with groundwater recharge service more comprehensively.
