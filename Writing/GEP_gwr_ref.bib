  abstract = {This study applies a production function approach to value the groundwater recharge function of the Hadejia-Nguru wetlands in northern Nigeria. The groundwater recharge function supports dry season agricultural production which is dependent on groundwater abstraction for irrigation. Using survey data this paper first carries out an economic valuation of agricultural production, per hectare of irrigated land. We then value the recharge function as an environmental input into the dry season agricultural production and derive appropriate welfare change measures. Welfare change is calculated using the estimated production functions and hypothetical changes in groundwater recharge and hence, groundwater levels. By focusing on agricultural production dependent solely on groundwater resources from the shallow aquifer, this study establishes that the groundwater recharge function of the wetlands is of significant importance for the floodplain.},

  abstract = {Improved irrigation water management requires accurate scheduling of irrigations which in turn requires an accurate calculation of daily crop evapotranspiration (Et). Previous work by Neale et al. (1989) and Bausch (1993) have indicated that the reflectance-based crop coefficient (Kcr) for corn responded to crop growth anomalies and should improve irrigation scheduling. Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop a new procedure for using the Kcr in irrigation scheduling and present results of simulations comparing different basal crop coefficient (Kcb) curves for corn to evaluate their effects on estimated crop Et. Irrigation scheduling simulations were performed using SCHED, the USDA-ARS Irrigation Scheduling Program, and three Kcb curves (the one in SCHED, Wright's (1982) tabular data, and the Kcr-based Kcb). Simulated crop water use using the Kcb curve in SCHED was considerably greater during vegetative growth (60 to 100 mm) than simulated crop water use using Wright's Kcb or the Kcr derived Kcb curves for three growing seasons. Crop water use between the Kcr-basedKcb and Wright's Kcb were different by approximately 20 mm each growing season. Crop water use was less in 1990 and 1992 for the Kcr derived curve and greater for 1991; crop development was directly responsible for the differences. Although the differences between the Wright and Kcr basal crop curves were minimal, irrigations with the Kcr-based Kcb were more appropriately timed. Irrigations that are correctly timed minimize overirrigation as well as underirrigation.},

  abstract = {Calculations using a heat balance and a radiative transfer model have been done to study relations among evaporation coefficients and vegetation indices. The evaporation coefficients are the crop coefficient (defined as the ratio of total evaporation and reference crop evaporation) and the transpiration coefficient (defined as the ratio of unstressed transpiration and reference crop evaporation), while the vegetation indices considered in this study are the normalized difference, soil adjusted vegetation index, and transformed soil adjusted vegetation index. The reference crop evaporation has been calculated using the Priestley-Taylor equation. The observed variations of crop (wheat) height, leaf area index, and weather conditions for 30 days at Phoenix (Arizona), together with the reflectances of different types of soil in wet and dry states, are used in the simulation. The total evaporation calculated from the model compared well with lysimeter observations. Variations in soil evaporation can introduce considerable scatter in the relation between the crop coefficient and leaf area index, while this scatter is much less for the relation between transpiration coefficient and leaf area index. The simulation results for 30 days of crop and weather data and reflectances of 19 soil types in wet and dry conditions gave significant linear correlations between the transpiration coefficient and the vegetation indices, the explained variance (r2) being highest for the soil adjusted vegetation index (r2 = 0.88) and lowest for the normalized difference (r2= 0.81). A clump model is used to address the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the relationship between the transpiration coefficient and soil adjusted vegetation index. These simulated relationships between transpiration coefficient and vegetation indices for wheat are discussed in the context of the relationships derived from observations for several crops and grasses. The present analysis provides a theoretical basis for estimating transpiration from remotely sensed data.},

  abstract = {Evapotranspiration (ET) is the largest term after precipitation in terrestrial water budgets. Accurate estimates of ET are needed for numerous agricultural and natural resource management tasks and to project changes in hydrological cycles due to potential climate change. We explore recent methods that combine vegetation indices (VI) from satellites with ground measurements of actual ET (ETa) and meteorological data to project ETa over a wide range of biome types and scales of measurement, from local to global estimates. The majority of these use time-series imagery from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on the Terra satellite to project ET over seasons and years. The review explores the theoretical basis for the methods, the types of ancillary data needed, and their accuracy and limitations. Coefficients of determination between modeled ETa and measured ETa are in the range of 0.45--0.95, and root mean square errors are in the range of 10--30\% of mean ETa values across biomes, similar to methods that use thermal infrared bands to estimate ETa and within the range of accuracy of the ground measurements by which they are calibrated or validated. The advent of frequent-return satellites such as Terra and planed replacement platforms, and the increasing number of moisture and carbon flux tower sites over the globe, have made these methods feasible. Examples of operational algorithms for ET in agricultural and natural ecosystems are presented. The goal of the review is to enable potential end-users from different disciplines to adapt these methods to new applications that require spatially-distributed ET estimates.},

  abstract = {Crop coefficient (Kc)-based estimation of crop  evapotranspiration is one of the most commonly used methods for  irrigation water management. However, uncertainties of the generalized  dual crop coefficient (Kc) method of the Food and  Agricultural Organization of the United Nations Irrigation and Drainage  Paper No. 56 can contribute to crop evapotranspiration estimates that  are substantially different from actual crop evapotranspiration.  Similarities between the crop coefficient curve and a satellite-derived  vegetation index showed potential for modeling a crop coefficient as a  function of the vegetation index. Therefore, the possibility of directly  estimating the crop coefficient from satellite reflectance of a crop  was investigated. The Kc data used in developing the relationship with NDVI were derived from back-calculations of the FAO-56 dual crop  coefficients procedure using field data obtained during 2007 from  representative US cropping systems in the High Plains from AmeriFlux  sites. A simple linear regression model (                                                   ) is developed to establish a general relationship  between a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from a moderate resolution satellite data (MODIS) and the crop coefficient (Kc)  calculated from the flux data measured for different crops and cropping  practices using AmeriFlux towers. There was a strong linear correlation  between the NDVI-estimated Kc and the measured Kc with an r2 of 0.91 and 0.90, while the root-mean-square error (RMSE) for Kc in 2006 and 2007 were 0.16 and 0.19, respectively. The procedure for quantifying crop coefficients from NDVI data presented in this paper should be useful in other regions of the  globe to understand regional irrigation water consumption.},

Yet while countless hydrographic maps exist for well-known river basins and individual nations, there is a lack of seamless high-quality data on large scales such as continents or the entire globe. Data for many large international basins are patchy, and remote areas are often poorly mapped.In response to these limitations, a team of scientists has developed data and created maps of the world's rivers that provide the research community with more reliable information about where streams and watersheds occur on the Earth's surface and how water drains the landscape.

In order to address these challenges, the scientific community needs to create improved large-scale datasets and more flexible data structures that enable the integration of information across and within spatial scales; develop new and advanced models that support the assessment of longitudinal and lateral hydrological connectivity; and provide an accessible modeling environment for researchers, decision makers, and practitioners. As a contribution, we here present a new modeling framework that integrates hydrographic baseline data at a global scale (enhanced HydroSHEDS layers and coupled datasets) with new modeling tools, specifically a river network routing model (HydroROUT) that is currently under development. The resulting `hydro-spatial fabric' is designed to provide an avenue for advanced hydro-ecological applications at large scales in a consistent and highly versatile way. Preliminary results from case studies to assess human impacts on water quality and the effects of dams on river fragmentation and downstream flow regulation illustrate the potential of this combined data-and-modeling framework to conduct novel research in the fields of aquatic ecology, biogeochemistry, geo-statistical modeling, or pollution and health risk assessments. The global scale outcomes are at a previously unachieved spatial resolution of 500 m and can thus support local planning and decision making in many of the world's large river basins.

  abstract = {The evapotranspiration / potential evapotranspiration (AET / PET) ratio is traditionally termed as the crop coefficient (Kc) and has been generally used as ecosystem evaporative stress index. In the current hydrology literature, Kc has been widely used as a parameter to estimate crop water demand by water managers but has not been well examined for other types of ecosystems such as forests and other perennial vegetation. Understanding the seasonal dynamics of this variable for all ecosystems is important for projecting the ecohydrological responses to climate change and accurately quantifying water use at watershed to global scales. This study aimed at deriving monthly Kc for multiple vegetation cover types and understanding its environmental controls by analyzing the accumulated global eddy flux (FLUXNET) data. We examined monthly Kc data for seven vegetation covers, including open shrubland (OS), cropland (CRO), grassland (GRA), deciduous broad leaf forest (DBF), evergreen needle leaf forest (ENF), evergreen broad leaf forest (EBF), and mixed forest (MF), across 81 sites. We found that, except for evergreen forests (EBF and ENF), Kc values had large seasonal variation across all land covers. The spatial variability of Kc was well explained by latitude, suggesting site factors are a major control on Kc. Seasonally, Kc increased significantly with precipitation in the summer months, except in EBF. Moreover, leaf area index (LAI) significantly influenced monthly Kc in all land covers, except in EBF. During the peak growing season, forests had the highest Kc values, while croplands (CRO) had the lowest. We developed a series of multivariate linear monthly regression models for Kc by land cover type and season using LAI, site latitude, and monthly precipitation as independent variables. The Kc models are useful for understanding water stress in different ecosystems under climate change and variability as well as for estimating seasonal ET for large areas with mixed land covers.},

However, quantifying global groundwater withdrawals remains a significant challenge due to inherent uncertainties in input data, sectoral allocation assumptions, and model parameterization. In this study, we analyze global groundwater withdrawals from 2001 to 2020 using a newly developed data-driven Global Groundwater Withdrawal (GGW) model and quantify uncertainties through Monte Carlo simulations. The GGW model integrates reported country-level data with global grid-based datasets to estimate annual withdrawals across domestic, industrial, and agricultural sectors at a 0.1{$^\circ$} resolution ({$\approx$}10 km). Our results indicate an average global groundwater withdrawal of 648 km3 a-1, with an uncertainty range of 465--881 km3 a-1. Agriculture accounts for 50\% of total withdrawals, followed by domestic use at 34.5\% and industrial use at 15.5\%. Temporal analysis shows increasing groundwater withdrawal in 66\% of the 44 IPCC WGI reference regions over the 20 years, with a global average annual increase of 0.5\% (varying regionally from 6.5\% annual increase to 9\% annual decrease). Comparison with previous studies highlights the impact of methodological choices and assumptions about groundwater withdrawal on the resulting global estimates. Our findings underscore the need for comprehensive uncertainty assessments and improved datasets. Expanding spatial coverage in underrepresented regions and enhancing temporal resolution, particularly for dynamic variables like irrigated areas, are crucial for more accurate groundwater withdrawal assessments. These improvements will enable better management and conservation of this vital resource in the face of growing global demands and climate change impacts.},

  abstract = {Gross domestic product (GDP) summarizes a vast amount of economic information in a single monetary metric that is widely used by decision makers around the world. However, GDP fails to capture fully the contributions of nature to economic activity and human well-being. To address this critical omission, we develop a measure of gross ecosystem product (GEP) that summarizes the value of ecosystem services in a single monetary metric. We illustrate the measurement of GEP through an application to the Chinese province of Qinghai, showing that the approach is tractable using available data. Known as the ``water tower of Asia,'' Qinghai is the source of the Mekong, Yangtze, and Yellow Rivers, and indeed, we find that water-related ecosystem services make up nearly two-thirds of the value of GEP for Qinghai. Importantly most of these benefits accrue downstream. In Qinghai, GEP was greater than GDP in 2000 and three-fourths as large as GDP in 2015 as its market economy grew. Large-scale investment in restoration resulted in improvements in the flows of ecosystem services measured in GEP (127.5\%) over this period. Going forward, China is using GEP in decision making in multiple ways, as part of a transformation to inclusive, green growth. This includes investing in conservation of ecosystem assets to secure provision of ecosystem services through transregional compensation payments.},

  abstract = {Preserving natural capital and the services it provides to humanity is crucial, yet integrating ecosystem services (ES) into policy and practice remains challenging. The Gross Ecosystem Product (GEP) concept was introduced as an aggregate monetary value of ES, offering a new metric to guide decision-making beyond traditional economic indicators like GDP. Originally developed in China, this study adapts the GEP framework to the European context, using a case study in the Apennines east of Parma, Italy. The methodology involves identifying key ES, biophysical quantification, and economic valuation to aggregate these into a single GEP metric. Results demonstrate that regulating services, such as habitat quality and erosion protection, significantly contribute to GEP, highlighting the essential link between ecological and economic systems. This approach supports spatial policy development, natural capital enhancement, and community planning, providing a comprehensive tool for integrating ES values into broader decision-making contexts, from national accounting systems to urban and regional planning.},

  abstract = {Hydrologic soil groups (HSGs) are a fundamental component of the USDA curve-number (CN) method for estimation of rainfall runoff; yet these data are not readily available in a format or spatial-resolution suitable for regional- and global-scale modeling applications. We developed a globally consistent, gridded dataset defining HSGs from soil texture, bedrock depth, and groundwater. The resulting data product---HYSOGs250m---represents runoff potential at 250\,m spatial resolution. Our analysis indicates that the global distribution of soil is dominated by moderately high runoff potential, followed by moderately low, high, and low runoff potential. Low runoff potential, sandy soils are found primarily in parts of the Sahara and Arabian Deserts. High runoff potential soils occur predominantly within tropical and sub-tropical regions. No clear pattern could be discerned for moderately low runoff potential soils, as they occur in arid and humid environments and at both high and low elevations. Potential applications of this data include CN-based runoff modeling, flood risk assessment, and as a covariate for biogeographical analysis of vegetation distributions.},
